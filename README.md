# Building_roof_classification_on_3D_building_model
In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, 3D city models have become more accurate and complex.Â Despite their widespread availability of open-source 3D city model datasets, these invaluable resources remain underutilized. Our primary goal centers on the classification of building and roof types. For our client, Spotr, our work directly impacts on their current project of house value estimations for insurance companies. Beyond insurance, it can be used in energy level rating, sustainability assessments, and so on. 
In classification schema design, we designed 15 building types and 7 roof types that are compiled with cities in Europe. We labeled 6599 buildings and 2551 roofs in total using CityJSON files of Delft, Rotterdam, Den Haag, Munich, and Berlin. The accuracy for building classification is 70% and for roof classification is 74%. 
For future work, we can increase the labeling amount and include more data from different regions. What's more, it can be extended to 2D roof classification: With the help of 3D roof surfaces, we can easily have the bounding box of the roof and additional 3D features can also be used.
